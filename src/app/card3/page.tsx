        <b>What are the Sustainable Development Goals?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These goals, also known as the SDGs, aim to end poverty, protect the
        planet and ensure prosperity for everyone by 2030. At Sightsavers, we
        make sure all our work helps to achieve these goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly all the countries in the world have promised to improve the
        planet and the lives of its citizens by 2030. Theyâ€™ve committed
        themselves to 17 life-changing goals, outlined by the UN in 2015. These
        targets, known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), include
        ending extreme poverty, giving people better healthcare, and achieving
        equality for women. The aim is for all countries to work together to
        ensure no one is left behind. Here you can read about the goals and
        learn how Sightsavers is helping to achieve them.
