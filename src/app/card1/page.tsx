        Gaza was a part of what was khown as <b>Palestine</b>, prior to the
        creation of the state of Israel, in 1948. As part of historical
        Palestine, it become the part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1500s and after World
        War I ,it become under Britian until 1948.

        The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of the World's most enduring
        conflict, with the Israeli occupation if the West Bank and the Gaza
        Strip reaching 54 years of conflict. Various attempt have been made to
        resolve the conflict as part of Israeli-Palestinian peace process.

        Israelis and Palestinians have failed to established a definitive peace
        accord despite a long-running peace process. The Oslo Accords of
        1993-1995 made progress towards a two-station solution, but Palistine in
        Gaza Strip and 165 "Island" around the West Bank remain undrer Israeli
        military rule.

        The outbreak of violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict began on
        May 10,2021. The "one-state solution" is a proposal for resoling the
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict by forming a unitary, fedral or confederate
        Israeli-Palestinian state that would include all of Israeli,s current
        terrritory , the West Bank , including East Jerusalam and possibly the
        Gaza Strip and Golan Heights. A "one-state solution" to the
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict is presented as either a situation in which
        Israel losses its Jewish character or the Palistine fails to acheive
        National Independance within a two-state solution.

        Even when things are really tough, the people in Gaza showsus, how
        strong they can be <em>Like a light in the dark</em>, their sourage
        shines through the storm. One biggest challenge is a blockage, a kind of
        barrier that make it hard for things to go in or out. There are fights,
        loud and scary like thunderstorm. Houses, hospitals and schools get
        caught in Israel hands.
