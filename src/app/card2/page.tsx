    <p>Life is a stage, peoples play 7 roles according to their ages. The stages are: infancy, schoolboy, teenager, young man, middle aged, old aged and dotage & death.</p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Infancy</h2>
      <p>
        In the first stage, in this phase of his life, a man appears as a child
        in the world. As a child, he is a helpless creature. He cries in his
        nurse’s arms for one reason or the other. He cries and vomits.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Schoolboy</h2>
      <p>
        This is where his formal education starts but he is not entirely happy
        with school. His mother is ambitious for him and has washed his face
        thoroughly before sending him off to school but he goes very slowly and
        reluctantly.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Teenager</h2>
      <p>
        He’s grown into his late teens and his main interest is girls. He’s
        likely to make a bit of a fool of himself with them. He is sentimental,
        sighing and writing poems to girls, making himself a bit ridiculous.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Young man</h2>
      <p>
        He’s a bold and fearless soldier – passionate in the causes he’s
        prepared to fight for and quickly springs into action. He works on
        developing his reputation and takes risks to that end.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Middle-aged</h2>
      <p>
        He regards himself as wise and experienced and doesn’t mind sharing his
        views and ideas with anyone and likes making speeches. He’s made a name
        for himself and is prosperous and respected. As a result of his success,
        he’s become vain. He enjoys the finer things in life, like good food.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Old man</h2>
      <p>
        He is old and nothing like his former self – physically or mentally. He
        looks and behaves like an old man, dresses like one and he has a thin
        piping voice now. His influence slips away.
      </p>

      <h2 className="heading2">Dotage and death</h2>
      <p>
        The final stage returns to a state of dependency, where the man loses
        his faculties and reverts to a state akin to infancy, often needing care
