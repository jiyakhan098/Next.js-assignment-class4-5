        <strong>The Role of Women in the Pakistan Movement</strong>
        Women in Pakistan make up 48.76% of the population according to the 2017
        census of Pakistan. Women in Pakistan have played an important role in
        Pakistani history and have had the right to vote since 1956. In
        Pakistan, women have held high office including Prime Minister, Speaker
        of the National Assembly, Leader of the Opposition, as well as federal
        ministers, judges, and serving commissioned posts in the armed forces,
        with Lieutenant General Nigar Johar attaining the highest military post
        for a woman. Benazir Bhutto was sworn in as the first woman Prime
        Minister of Pakistan on 2 December 1988. The status of women in Pakistan
        varies across classes, regions and the rural/urban divide due to
        socioeconomic differences and the impact of tribal and feudal social
        traditions. Gender Concerns International reports that women's rights in
        Pakistan have improved overall, with the increasing number of educated
        and literate women. However, Pakistani women have been kept behind in
        the field of education due to low government funding, fewer schools and
        colleges for women, and a low enrollment rate of women in certain areas.
        Cases of rape, honor killing, murder, and forced marriages in backward
        areas are also reported. All these issues are related to lack of
        education, poverty, a skewed judicial system, the negligence of
        government authorities to implement laws and widespread underperformance
        of law enforcement agencies such as the Police.

        Historically, Muslim reformers such as Syed Ahmad Khan tried to bring
        education to women, limit polygamy, and empower women in other ways
        through education. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was
        known to have a positive attitude towards women. After the
        independence of Pakistan, women's groups and feminist organizations
        initiated by prominent leaders like Fatima Jinnah started to emerge in
        order to eliminate socio-economic injustices against women in the
        country. Jinnah pointed out that Muslim women leaders from all classes
        actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their
        movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians.
        Women were sometimes organized into large-scale public demonstrations.
        Before 1947, there was a tendency for Muslim women in Punjab to vote for
        the Muslim League while their menfolk supported the Unionist Party.
        Many Muslim women supported the Indian National Congress Quit India
        Movement. Some like Syeda Safia Begum of Muslim Town Lahore started the
        first English School for Muslim Children in Muslim Town in 1935.
        Pakistani women were granted the suffrage in 1947, and they were
        reaffirmed the right to vote in national elections in 1956 under the
        interim Constitution. The provision of reservation of seats for
        women in the Parliament existed throughout the constitutional history of
        Pakistan from 1956 to 1973. Had General Ayub Khan run fair elections,
        Ms. Fatima Jinnah of Pakistan would have become the first Muslim
        President of the largest Muslim country in the world. However, despite
        that setback, during 1950-60, several pro-women initiatives were taken.
        Also, the first woman Lambardar or Numberdar (Village Head Person) in
        West Pakistan Begum Sarwat Imtiaz took oath in Village 43/12-L in
        Chichawatni, District Montgomery (now Sahiwal) in 1959. The 1961 Muslim
        Family Law Ordinance, which regulated marriage, divorce, and
        polygamy continues to have a significant legal impact on the women
        of Pakistan.
